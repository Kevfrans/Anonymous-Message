      <h1>My Confession</h1>
      <p>Hi Justin, before this year end I just wanted to say of all the people nga nakilala ko ikaw ang pinaka extraordinary person that i I've ever meet, i like you not because of your appearance but bcuz of your actions and the way you teach others what to do, i still even remember the time that I single handedly work on our case study and i was expecting of some kind of appreciation but i was surprised that you rebuked me and corrected me in a way that i learned something valuable, and also i like you bcuz you also believe in God
      and that is what I'm looking for in a girl or perhaps a woman of God. i still can't believe that you surpassed my stanards but sadly I know that you are just going to be another life lesson but even so i still thank God that He brought you into my life i wish i could tell you how i truly feel personaly but you seem to pre-ocupied with school works and other matters so I've decided to confess through one thing that I enjoy doing and that is coding i hope that after reading this our friendship will not be affected. I love you Justin thank you for helping me become better Thank you for being part of my life. idk if your the one but either way i pray that the one man destined to be with you will guide you and be there with you always.</p>
      <p>In short Gusto kita .</p>
      <p>From your annoying friend: Kevin, I hope this makes you smile. </p>
